## Discussion Topics
1. How do you balance flexibility vs complexity in dialog management?
2. What are the trade-offs between different testing approaches?
3. How do you handle versioning for different components (bot, intent, lambda)?
4. What metrics best indicate bot performance and user satisfaction?
